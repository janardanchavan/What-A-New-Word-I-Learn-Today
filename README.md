# What-A-New-Word-I-Learn-Today
This is a start of one of my project idea with learning for my kids, students and all the friends.

### It took a village
“It takes a village to raise a child” is an African proverb that means a community of people must work together to raise a child in a safe and healthy environment. The proverb conveys the idea that raising a child is not the sole responsibility of the parents, but rather a responsibility shared by the entire community. <br/>
> It takes a village to raise a child. <br/>
> It took a village to come together to get us through this phase.
